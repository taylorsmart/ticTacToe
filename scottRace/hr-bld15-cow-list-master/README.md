## Instructions

Read this entire document before starting your work. Complete the work in order. There is a hints section at the end.

## Goal

Create a CRUD app using React (without Redux) that interfaces with a RESTful API powered by Node (with Express) and a database (MySQL) from scratch.

Don't use anything that writes code for you (like `create-react-app`). Don't forget to commit regularly and upload your work to GitHub!

Stick to using only the official documentation and StackOverflow. Limit your use of video and blog post tutorials. Whenever you find a solution on StackOverflow, always find where in the official documentation you can find the same answer.

### Permitted technlogies

1. For server: Node.js with [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
1. For frontend: [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) with JSX
1. For AJAX requests: [jQuery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery), [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios),or fetch
1. For database: MySQL (with [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql))

Do not use jQuery for any DOM manipulations.

## Bare Minimum Requirements

### Backend Requirements

Create a RESTful API for a resource named `cows` that responds to the following endpoints:

| intention           | request type | request url | request body                              | side effect                    | response body                                                                    |
| ------------------- | :----------: | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| read all cow data   |     GET      | `/api/cows` | none                                      | none                           | `[{name: 'Buttercup', description: '...'}, {name: 'Daisy', description: '...'}]` |
| create new cow data |     POST     | `/api/cows` | `{name: 'Milkshake', description: '...'}` | creates new record in database | `{name: 'Milkshake', description: '...'}`                                        |

Your web server should 100% be interfacing with a database for this phase. Confirm this functionality is working properly with Postman (recommended) or via the `curl` command in your terminal.

### Frontend Requirements

Build the `Create` and `Read` functionality of a CRUD app using React. The frontend should make use of the already created, in the previous section, RESTful API endpoints to accomplish the following user stories:

1. When the user loads the page, the user should see a list of all names of previously created cows (but not their descriptions).

1. When the user types the name and description of a new cow they want to input into the database and presses the `[Submit]` button, the newly created cow's information should be displayed in the list from the previous step **only after the data has been successfully written to the database**.

1. When the user clicks on the name of a cow, the name and description of that cow should be displayed prominently at the top of the page (so as to mimic the functionality of a modal/popup that shows the details of a particular cow).

   a. Only the details of the most recently clicked cow should be prominently displayed at the top of the page at a time. For example, if `Betsy` is the first cow clicked, `Betsy`'s information should be displayed. If `Milkshake` is clicked afterwards, only `Milkshake`'s information should be displayed. `Betsy`'s description should no longer be visible.

   b. The details of any clicked cow should be prominently displayed in the same location in the DOM at the top of the page (aka not within the clicked component).

### Example Data:

| id  | name      | description                                                                                                                                                     |
| --- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Buttercup | a herbaceous plant with bright yellow cup-shaped flowers, common in grassland and as a garden weed. All kinds are poisonous and generally avoided by livestock. |
| 2   | Daisy     | a small grassland plant that has flowers with a yellow disk and white rays. It has given rise to many ornamental garden varieties.                              |
| 3   | Milkshake | a cold drink made of milk, a sweet flavoring such as fruit or chocolate, and typically ice cream, whisked until it is frothy.                                   |
| 4   | Bessie    | a person's best or closest friend.                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | MooDonna  | archaic : lady -- used as a form of respectful address.                                                                                                         |
| 6   | MooLawn   | a legendary Chinese warrior from the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420â€“589) of Chinese history.                                                       |

Note: This data is not intended to be inserted into the database by a script. Rather, it is intended to be manually inserted one-by-one into the database via the React app.

```
This is the end of the Bare Minimum Requirements section.
```

## More Practice

Add the backend functionality that allows users to update existing records and delete existing records. The response from the RESTful API should be that of the updated (or deleted) record.

| intention             | request type | request url     | request body          | side effect                                                  | response body                             |
| --------------------- | :----------: | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| update one cow's data |     PUT      | `/api/cows/:id` | `{name: 'BuTtErCuP'}` | updates record for specified id with new name of `BuTtErCuP` | `{name: 'BuTtErCuP', description: '...'}` |
| delete one cow's data |    DELETE    | `/api/cows/:id` | none                  | deletes record for specified id                              | `{name: 'BuTtErCuP', description: '...'}` |

Confirm this functionality is working properly with Postman (recommended) or via the `curl` command in your terminal.

Next, add the frontend functionality that allows users to edit existing records and delete existing records (via your RESTful API).
